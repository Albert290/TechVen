// This file is currently empty as no complex JavaScript is needed for a simple maintenance page.
// You can add JS here later if you want to implement features like:
// - Countdown timer
// - Background animations (e.g., particles)
// - Form for email notifications
// - etc.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('TechVen maintenance page loaded.');
    // Example: If you wanted to do something after the page loads
    // You could add classes for more complex animations or dynamic content here.
